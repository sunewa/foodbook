            >Currently, the federation is hosting a website that provides information about the executive board of national offices and state wise offices. There is also a section for programs that are being organized by the federation and also provides a calendar with the programs and events. There is also a tab for contact information of national offices and other state offices. Since it is a huge organization with members from all around the nation, there are many members that include professional chefs, cooks, culinary students and apprentices. Basically, it includes members who can teach and who want to learn. Also, the members who want to develop their career or establish their company by sharing their culinary skills and recipes. The federation wants us to develop a networking application for their members or any food enthusiast where people can share their recipe or even sell their food. Moreover, this platform will be helpful for people who want to learn about culinary arts from adept personnel. The members can also hire highly rated chefs for events. After careful consideration of the client’s requirements, we will develop a web application that has networking features, blogging features and members can hire the chefs.</p>
